## Tests for Identical .cmi files:

Here we generate a basic `.mli` file with two types and a function:

  $ cat > ref.mli << EOF
  > type t = int
  > type unused_type = string
  > val f : t -> string
  > EOF

We generate the .cmi file

  $ ocamlc ref.mli

And now we run api-watcher on that same cmi file as both arguments,
there should be no diff:

  $ api-diff ref.cmi ref.cmi
